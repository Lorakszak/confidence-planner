This is often called an 'exact' method, because it is based on the cumulative probabilities of the binomial distribution (i.e., exactly the correct distribution rather than an approximation).

Unlike the symmetric normal approximation interval, the Wilson score interval is asymmetric. It does not suffer from problems of overshoot and zero-width intervals that afflict the normal interval, and it may be safely employed with small samples and skewed observations.<br>\n",

    "Wilson intervals get their assymetry from the underlying likelihood function for the binomial, which is used to compute the \"expected standard error\" and \"score\" (i.e., first derivative of the likelihood function) under the null hypotheisis. Since these values will change as you very your null hypothesis, the interval where the normalized score (score/expected standard error) exceeds your pre-specified Z-cutoff for significance will not be symmetric, in general."
