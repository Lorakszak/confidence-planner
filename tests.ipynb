    "### Examplary description\n",
    "The application provides different methods for calculating confidence interval for obtained accuracy from different training techniques. The aim of the confidence interval is to measure the degree of uncertainty or certainty in a sampling method. There are two available options and number of tests to choose from:\n",
    "- holdout\n",
    "    - Z-test -> use when holdout sample size is big (>30) and you know standard deviation\n",
    "    - Z-test with confidence -> use when holdout sample size is big (>30) and you don't know standard deviation\n",
    "    - T-test -> use when holdout sample size is small (<30) and you know standard deviation\n",
    "    - Loose test set bound -> use to obtain wide intervals\n",
    "    - Clopper-Pearson -> use to obtain narrow intervals\n",
    "    - Wilson score -> use to obtain the narrowest intervals\n",
    "- for bootstrap\n",
    "    - Percentile Bootstrap Method -> use when number of bootstrap resamples is big\n",
    "    - Standard error method -> use when you know additionally overall accuracy of bootstrap resamples\n",
    "    \n",
    "Moreover, for z-test and loose test set bound there are reverse tests. With their help, when you know what confidence interval you want to obtain at a given confidence, tests will return number of samples needed for a holdout method."

    "#### Wilson score interval\n",
    "The Wilson score interval is an improvement over the normal approximation interval in multiple respects. Unlike the symmetric normal approximation interval, the Wilson score interval is asymmetric. It does not suffer from problems of overshoot and zero-width intervals that afflict the normal interval, and it may be safely employed with small samples and skewed observations.<br>\n",
    "The Wilson interval is derived from the Wilson Score Test, which belongs to a class of tests called Rao Score Tests. It relies on the asymptotic normality of your estimator.\n",
    "Wilson intervals get their assymetry from the underlying likelihood function for the binomial, which is used to compute the \"expected standard error\" and \"score\" (i.e., first derivative of the likelihood function) under the null hypotheisis. Since these values will change as you very your null hypothesis, the interval where the normalized score (score/expected standard error) exceeds your pre-specified Z-cutoff for significance will not be symmetric, in general."

A bootstrap percentile CI of θˆ (an estimator of θ) can be obtained as follows: (1) B random bootstrap samples are generated, (2) a parameter estimate is calculated from each bootstrap sample, (3) all B bootstrap parameter estimates are ordered from the lowest to highest, and (4) the CI is constructed as follows,<br>\n",
